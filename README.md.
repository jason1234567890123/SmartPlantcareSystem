SMART PLANT CARE SYSTEM

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Smart Plant Care System is designed to monitor soil moisture levels and provide alerts when the soil is too dry.
This system helps ensure that plants are properly watered, making it ideal for plant enthusiasts and home gardeners. 
I came up with this idea recently for my mum's birthday to help her maintain her indoor plants without hassle.

COMPONENETS
- Arduino Uno
- Soil moisture sensor
- LED
- 3-pin buzzer
- 220Ω resistor for LED
- Breadboard and jumper wires

CIRCUIT DIAGRAM
Since I primarily used Tinkercad for the design and simulation of this project, a physical diagram isn't included. However, the connections are as follows:
- Soil Moisture Sensor:
  - VCC to 5V rail
  - GND to GND rail
  - SIG to A0 on the Arduino
- LED:
  - Anode to digital pin 9 via a 220Ω resistor
  - Cathode to GND
- Buzzer:
  - VCC to 5V rail
  - GND to GND rail
  - SIG to digital pin 10

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
1. Assemble the Components:
   - Connect the soil moisture sensor's VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and SIG to A0 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the LED's anode to digital pin 9 via a 220Ω resistor and the cathode to GND.
   - Connect the buzzer's VCC to 5V, GND to GND, and SIG to digital pin 10.
2. Upload the Code:
   - Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided code to the Arduino Uno.

CODE EXPLANATION
```cpp
int ledPin = 9;
int sensorPin = A0;
int buzzerPin = 10;
int sensorValue = 0;
int threshold = 500;

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  sensorValue = analogRead(sensorPin);
  Serial.print("Sensor Value: ");
  Serial.println(sensorValue);

  if (sensorValue >= threshold) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
    tone(buzzerPin, 1000);
    Serial.println("Soil is too dry. LED and Buzzer ON.");
  } else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
    noTone(buzzerPin);
    Serial.println("Soil moisture is sufficient. LED and Buzzer OFF.");
  }
  delay(1000);
}
The code reads the soil moisture level from the sensor. If the soil is too dry (sensor value >= threshold), it activates the LED and buzzer. Otherwise, it keeps them off.

USAGE
1. **Monitor Soil Moisture:**
   - Insert the soil moisture sensor into the soil.
   - The system will automatically alert you if the soil is too dry by lighting up the LED and sounding the buzzer.
2. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - You can adjust the threshold in the code to match your specific soil and plant needs.

ADDITIONAL NOTES
- This project was developed using Tinkercad for design and simulation.
- It provides a practical solution for maintaining plant health, ensuring plants are watered properly.
